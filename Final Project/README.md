#### GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
My final project is a tribute page for one of my favorite games: Life Is Strange.
I decided to create this tribute because I have a deep love and connection to the game.
Life Is Strange resonated with me on multiple levels, captivating me with its immersive storyline, thought-provoking choices, and memorable characters.
For my tribute page, I developed a website that emulates the official site of the game, offering users the opportunity to purchase the game directly from the site.
I dedicated significant effort to ensuring the website is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
The website comprises two HTML files: "home" and "faq".
The "home" page showcases a captivating presentation of the game, featuring an engaging trailer that draws visitors into the game's world.
Additionally, I strategically placed four buttons within the "Buy" section, offering reliable and secure links for purchasing the game from different platforms.
In the navigation bar, I incorporated the "Home," "FAQ," and "Games" options. When users first open the site, they are immediately directed to the "Home" screen, with the corresponding tab highlighted in white to indicate their current location.
If users click on the "FAQ" tab, they are seamlessly taken to the FAQ page, which also appears highlighted in white.
The "Games" option functions as a dropdown menu, providing a comprehensive list of Life Is Strange games.
Clicking on any of the game options redirects users to the official page for that specific game.
The center of the navigation bar features the game's logo, which serves as a link to the official game page.

When users hover their cursor over the logo, a subtle zoom effect enhances the interactive experience.
By incorporating these features into the website, I aimed to create a user-friendly and immersive environment that replicates the authenticity of the
official game site.
The addition of the navigation bar and its interactive elements further enhances the overall experience, allowing users to effortlessly navigate
through different sections and explore the richness of the Life Is Strange universe.
I am immensely proud of the final result and believe that it effectively captures the essence of the game while providing an enjoyable and engaging
experience for visitors to the tribute page.

#### HOME.HTML FILE

The HTML file represents a tribute page for the game "Life is Strange: True Colors." The page begins with the inclusion of necessary meta tags for
character encoding, viewport settings, and page information. It also links the Bootstrap CSS framework to ensure a responsive layout.

The content of the page is enclosed within the <body> tag. The navigation bar, styled with the Bootstrap classes, is fixed to the top of the page using
the navbar-fixed-top class. It consists of a collapsible menu button and a logo of the game, which is a clickable link to the official website. The
menu items include "Home," "FAQ," and a dropdown menu for other "Games" in the series. Each menu item is represented by an <a> tag with appropriate
attributes and links.
Below the navigation bar, there is an image container that displays the main image of the game along with a video overlay. The overlay contains an
embedded YouTube video trailer, which is responsive and adjusts to the width of the container. Additionally, there is a "Buy" button positioned on top
of the video overlay, which triggers a function to scroll to the next section of the page.
After the image container, there is a section with a title and paragraphs that describe the essence of "Life is Strange." It highlights the series as a
collection of award-winning and critically acclaimed narrative adventure games. The text emphasizes the presence of supernatural powers, real-life
challenges, relationships, and emotions within the game's universe.
Following that, there is a section dedicated to the "Buy Now" option. It includes a title, "BUY NOW," and a container with four buttons representing
different platforms where the game can be purchased. Each button is a clickable image with a link to the corresponding platform's store page. The
platforms include PlayStation 5, Xbox, Steam, and Playstation4.
Lastly, the page includes the necessary JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery and Popper.js, which are required for Bootstrap functionality. It also
includes a custom JavaScript function that scrolls the page to the "Buy Now" section when the "Buy" button is clicked.
Overall, the HTML file creates a visually appealing and interactive tribute page for "Life is Strange: True Colors," providing users with information
about the game, a captivating video trailer, and convenient options to purchase the game from various platforms.
